Since cursing and swearing had no apparent effect at all and changed
nothing in that sun-scorched inferno, he clenched his dry fists and raised
them heavenwards to the sun as it slowly descended, lengthening the shadows
before setting into the Mediterranean. The Levite begged God to perform a
miracle and allow Yeshua to die.
 When he opened his eyes again nothing on the hill had changed, except
that the light no longer flashed from the badges on the centurion's chest.
The sun was shining on the victims' backs, as their faces were turned east
towards Jerusalem. Then the Levite cried out:
 'I curse you. God! '
 In a hoarse voice he shouted that God was unjust and that he would
believe in him no more.
 'You are deaf! ' roared Matthew. ' If you were not deaf you would have
heard me and killed him in the instant!'
 His eyes tight shut, the Levite waited for the fire to strike him from
heaven. Nothing happened. Without opening his eyes, he vented his spite in a
torrent of insults to heaven. He shouted that his faith was ruined, that
there were other gods and better. No other god would have allowed a man like
Yeshua to be scorched to death on a pole.
 'No--I was wrong! ' screamed the Levite, now quite hoarse. ' You are a
God of evil! Or have your eyes been blinded by the smoke of sacrifices from
the temple and have your ears grown deaf to everything but the trumpet-calls
of the priests? You are not an almighty God--you are an evil God! I curse
you. God of robbers, their patron and protector! '
