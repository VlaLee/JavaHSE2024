Immutable arbitrary-precision integers. All operations behave as if BigIntegers were represented
in two's-complement notation (like Java's primitive integer types). BigInteger provides analogues to all of Java's
primitive integer operators, and all relevant methods from java.lang.Math. Additionally, BigInteger provides
operations for modular arithmetic, GCD calculation, primality testing, prime generation, bit manipulation,
and a few other miscellaneous operations. Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of Java's
integer arithmetic operators, as defined in The Java Language Specification. For example, division by zero throws
an ArithmeticException, and division of a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.
Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators to allow for negative shift distances.
A right-shift with a negative shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.
The unsigned right shift operator (>>>) is omitted since this operation only makes sense for a fixed sized
word and not for a representation conceptually having an infinite number of leading virtual sign bits.
Semantics of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java's bitwise integer operators.
The binary operators (and, or, xor) implicitly perform sign extension on the shorter of the two operands prior
to performing the operation. Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to those
performed by Java's relational and equality operators. Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute
residues, perform exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses. These methods always return a non-negative
result, between 0 and (modulus - 1), inclusive. Bit operations operate on a single bit of the two's-complement
representation of their operand. If necessary, the operand is sign-extended so that it contains the designated bit.
None of the single-bit operations can produce a BigInteger with a different sign from the BigInteger being
operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the arbitrarily large abstraction provided by this class
ensures that conceptually there are infinitely many "virtual sign bits" preceding each BigInteger.
